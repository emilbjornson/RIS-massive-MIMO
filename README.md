## Abstract of Article

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) consist of many passive elements of metamaterials whose impedance can be controllable to change the characteristics of wireless signals impinging on them. Channel estimation is a critical task when it comes to the control of a large RIS when having a channel with a large number of multipath components. In this paper, we derive Bayesian channel estimators for two RIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations: i) the short-term RIS configuration based on the instantaneous channel estimates; ii) the long-term RIS configuration based on the channel statistics. The proposed methods exploit spatial correlation characteristics at both the base station and the planar RISs, and other statistical characteristics of multi-specular fading in a mobile environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic for phase-shift selection at the RISs is developed. A computationally efficient fixed-point algorithm, which solves the max-min fairness power control optimally, is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed uplink RIS-aided framework improves the spectral efficiency of the cell-edge mobile user equipments substantially in comparison to a conventional single-cell massive MIMO system. The impact of several channel effects are studied to gain insight about when the channel estimation, i.e., the short-term configuration, is preferable in comparison to the long-term RIS configuration to boost the spectral efficiency.
